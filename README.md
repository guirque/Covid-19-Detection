# Covid-19 X-Ray Classification

## Goal

The goal is to create a CNN and train it so it is able to classify X-Ray chest images according to three categories (labels):
- Covid
- Normal
- Viral Pneumonia 

The dataset used is the [Covid-19 Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset), available on Kaggle.
